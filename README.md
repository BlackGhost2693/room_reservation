# Room Reservation Application

### Project Description:
As a listing owner, I want a system for making and tracking reservations that can be handled by third-party services.

* The system can be used by multiple listings.
* The system provides REST API endpoints:
-> To make reservations
-> To check if a number of rooms are available at a certain time
* A reservation is for a name (any string) and for a certain amount of time
* The listing owner can get an overview over the booked rooms as an HTML or TEXT report


Limitations:

* Authentication / Authorization is not in the scope of this task
* No localization needed

Hints:
* Use third-party packages where applicable!
